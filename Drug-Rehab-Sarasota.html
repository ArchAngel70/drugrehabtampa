In these facilities, staffs can be   underpaid and can therefore be less caring. This could also mean   substandard amenities like shared or too small rooms and they don’t   provide activities that would take your mind off of drugs. A real   alternative is an important part of recovery and this type of facilities   basically does not offer this option.
